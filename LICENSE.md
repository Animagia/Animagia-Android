Hovewer, starting April 22, 2019, we want to keep the option of switching to the more permissive BSD-3-Clause license open.

All contributions made on or after April 22, 2019 come with the agreement that they can be relicensed to BSD-3-Clause without asking the contributor. Any such relicensing still requires permission from authors of any works from before April 22, 2019 that the new contribution builds upon.
